# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

Project rules and architecture are documented centrally in `AGENTS.md`.

Warp (and other agents running in this repo) should read and follow `AGENTS.md` for all project-specific rules, build/test commands, and architectural notes.
