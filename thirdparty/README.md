# Third-Party Libraries

## common.mk

This file is a makefile that contains common rules for building and testing
copied from the [`common-utils`](https://github.com/massenz/common-utils) repository.

It needs to be copied here as it cannot be included in `Makefile` directly from the
original repository.
